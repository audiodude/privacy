More things for later

* add an expiration date to your key
  - link during creation, to say you can add this later
* bump your key forward once per year
* if making a new key, sign with old key first if possible
* make a revocation cert if your old key is compromised
* 9-backup of private key (e.g. paperkey)
* using an email client with PGP built in
* marking keys as trusted
* managing multiple keys you could sign with (when the default isn't the right one)
