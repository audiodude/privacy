Guides and support for communicating in private.

First task: a guide to encrypting one email.

### Encrypting one email

I've only ever sent one PGP encrypted email, and I've already forgotten how to do it.

I'm going to re-learn how to do it, and meticulously document the process, with commands and screenshots.

Then, I'm going to isolate concrete usability advancements to make the process easier for more people to actually do.

Not necessarily make it easy for everyone to send encrypted emails -- but I'd like to make it more feasible for motivated people to actually go through with it, when they're about to send an email whose privacy really matters.

Materials will be collected in this repository, and the issue tracker will double as a support forum.

I'll be working on this, with whoever wants to help, at the [Data Privacy Hackathon, Feb 8-9, 2014](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/data-privacy-legal-hackathon/hacks/sending-one-encrypted-email).
