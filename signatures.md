# What is signed email?, 
## or: What is this .asc attachment all about?

The .asc attachment on this message is my digital signature. If you set up your email to use PGP (pretty good privacy), this signature (and yours) will let us encrypt our conversations so that we are the only ones who can read the contents. It's like sending email in an envelope rather than written on a postcard.

A **verified signature** provides two properties:

* **authentication**: this message really is from me (your friend, not an impostor)
* **integrity**: this message hasn't been tampered with since me (your friend) wrote it

However, you'll need to verify the signature before you can be sure of either property. Just seeing this .asc attachment or some PGP-related gobbledy-gook at the bottom of an email message isn't enough to verify it (see *Insecure ways to verify signatures* below) as a message from your friend that hasn't been tampered with.
